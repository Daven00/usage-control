# Usage Control (UCS)

This repository (branch sifis-home) implements the Usage Control System for the SIFIS-Home project.

The repo on GitHub at [https://github.com/sifis-home/usage-control](https://github.com/sifis-home/usage-control) is a "push mirror" of the original repository on a CNR GitLab instance at [https://sssg-dev.iit.cnr.it/marco-rasori/new-ucs](https://sssg-dev.iit.cnr.it/marco-rasori/new-ucs).

Being a push mirror, all the changes have to be done at the repository hosted on the GitLab instance.
